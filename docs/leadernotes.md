# Exercise Leader notes

## Session set up
Have zoom fill up half of the screen and the exercise protocol on the other half so that you can always see what is next and monitor their HR.  Have a timer running so that every 5 minutes you can ask for symptoms and RPE so that the SO can record.
 
## Heart Rate
Make sure to look up the target HR before the session begins and keep the participant within that range.

## Target HR for Aerobic
65-80% of their symptom threshold max HR. This is found during their fitness at the time they terminate the test. (Whether it’s due to symptoms +3, exhaustion, etc) 
If it begins to go up, have them take water and breathe before moving onto the next exercise.

## Target HR for Balance
Below 65% of their symptom threshold max HR.

## Movement
Make sure that they are not moving their head up and down or side to side this may exacerbate concussion symptoms
 
## Cool Down
Make sure the participant has their HR coming back down and be able to see their breathing slow down.

## Symptom Increases
If symptoms increase +3 above baseline (minute 0 of the session) 1-minute break and reduce to 60% ST. If symptoms increase again, 1 min break and reduce to 40% (~100-110 bpm). If symptoms still increase, stop the session.
