## Communication 
If you need to communicate with Graduate Students, please use slack. If you need to communicate with each other regarding TECHS or lab specific things, I recommend you also use slack. Communication with Dr. Morris should be an email, unless he tells you otherwise! 

We will often use slack to ask people to help out with rescheduled sessions and to notify people about cancellations. That being said, we recommend keeping notifications on during working hours and the app downloaded on your phone.  

While we do not expect responses outside of working hours or weekends, we do ask you respond to messages within 24 hours. Participants tend to cancel and reschedule, especially with our virtual sessions. We appreciate your understanding and flexibility to help our last minute, but we completely understand that this isn't always possible! 

If you have to last minute miss an intervention session, it is your responsibility to find a cover. We ask you send a blast in the uga specific slack channel.  

If there is an emergency during a TECHS session- Call Emma immediately.
