# How to read the google calendar 
Calendar for the following week is set on the Friday of the week prior. We will not require you to come in the week of an event, but we may ask. Working with human subjects means there are lots of cancellations and rescheduling. [Join the calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y25lLmxhYi5uZXVAZ21haWwuY29t)
