                <h1 id="techs-safety-plan-and-safety-observer-role-description">TECHS Safety plan and Safety Observer role description</h1>
<p>Below is a list of possible adverse events during the virtual intervention sessions and the safety plan in the event each event occurs.
If you dont have hyperate on the computer, ask the session leader if they have it. If they dont, message Emma with the ID. 
HypeRate files should be named: hr_sub_ xx_dx (hr_sub_ 08_d5 would be techs 08 intervention 5)
The role of the safety observer is to monitor the safety of each participant and respond to falls, signs of distress, or other safety concernhs. Prior to the beginning of the intervention, the safety observer must close all windows on their computer to reduce distractions. The only windows that should be open during virtual intervention sessions care Zoom and the emergency contact list. Listed below are the appropriate responses to some anticipated situations. </p>
<h2 id="before-first-session">Before first session:</h2>
<p>Participant and session leader will meet 15 minutes prior to session to teach how to set up the zoom session and share screen.</p>
<h2 id="5-minutes-before-a-session-begins-the-safety-observer-will">5 minutes before a session begins the safety observer will:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Have the spreadsheet open/available with names, addresses, and contact information of the participant and their local emergency contact. </li>
<li>Have phone readily available to call participants. </li>
<li>Confirm participants are in their address previously collected.</li>
<li>Instruct participants that they must announce to the study staff if they are going to leave the screen (to get water, to sit down or to take a bathroom break).</li>
<li>Check for room safety</li>
<li>Chair must not have wheels</li>
<li>Either fully ON or fully off a rug</li>
<li>No objects in way of exercise space</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="during-the-session-safety-observer-will">During the session, safety observer will:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Observe for flushed face, increased perfusion, pale features</li>
<li>Monitor HR and record on redcap</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="after-the-session">After the session:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Record information on scheduling &amp; info document </li>
<li>Date of intervention</li>
<li>Intervention version</li>
<li>Record on redcap under Resistance the intervention version (A1, B2, etc) as well as Session leader and SO </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="possible-events-and-action-plans">Possible events and action plans:</h2>
<p>A.  The participant is off screen for more than 1 minute
  - Confer with the staff member leading the intervention to see if they observed the participant walk off screen, sit down, etc. 
  - Call the participant after 1 minute of them being off screen
  - If the participant does not answer, wait 1 minute and call again. You may also call an alternate number (home or cell phone)
  - If the participant does not answer the second phone call, call the participant’s local emergency contact</p>
<p>B.  The participant appears to be struggling with exercise (e.g. taking more breaks than normal, visibly in pain).
  - Stop the session to check-in and make sure they are okay. If the participant would like to continue exercising, advise the participant to modify (e.g., reduce intensity or do exercises seated) if needed.
  - Pay special attention to monitoring this participant for the remainder of class, calling again if concerned for their safety. If the participant completes the class and you remain concerned about their health status, then call them after class and ask how they are feeling. Then inform Dr. Morris of the situation by contacting him.</p>
<p>C.  The participant falls or is in respiratory distress
  - If the participant has clearly fallen and is not getting up, then immediately stop the class using your Zoom video and microphone and call out to the participant to see if they are responsive. If non-responsive, then call emergency services and provide them with the participant’s address.
  - If the situation is non-emergent, immediately call the participant to check-in and make sure they are okay. If the participant is unsure if they need help and is having  difficulty breathing, chest pain, or irregular heart rate or other cardiac issue, then ask the participant if there is anyone in the home to help assess the participant and call 911. If no one is available, then call emergency services and provide them with the participant’s address.
  - If the participant does not answer, immediately call the participant’s local emergency contact and ask the contact to check on the participant. If the emergency contact person is unavailable or unable to reach the participant, then contact emergency services.</p>
<p>D. Technical difficulties
  - Call participant and assist them through this technology issue.</p>
<p>E. other person or animal enters the room
  - Pause the session and ask if they will be able to be alone shortly. If not, reschedule session.</p>
<p>Heart Rate Debugging Steps
- Disconnect and reconnect HR monitor from hyperate app
- Disconnect and reconnect HR monitor from bluetooth settings in phone
- Put water on the strap (not the actual monitor)
- Unclip and reclip the monitor from the strap</p>
