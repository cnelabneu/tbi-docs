<p>Below is a list of possible adverse events during the virtual intervention sessions and the safety plan in the event each event occurs.
If you dont have hyperate on the computer, ask the session leader if they have it. If they dont, message Emma with the ID. 
HypeRate files should be named: hr_sub_ xx_dx (hr_sub_ 08_d5 would be techs 08 intervention 5)
The role of the safety observer is to monitor the safety of each participant and respond to falls, signs of distress, or other safety concerns. Prior to the beginning of the intervention, the safety observer must close all windows on their computer to reduce distractions. The only windows that should be open during virtual intervention sessions care Zoom and the emergency contact list. Listed below are the appropriate responses to some anticipated situations. </p>
<h2 id="before-first-session">Before first session:</h2>
<p>Participant and session leader will meet 15 minutes prior to session to teach how to set up the zoom session and share screen.</p>
<h2 id="5-minutes-before-a-session-begins-the-safety-observer-will">5 minutes before a session begins the safety observer will:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Have the spreadsheet open/available with names, addresses, and contact information of the participant and their local emergency contact. </li>
<li>Have phone readily available to call participants. </li>
<li>Confirm participants are in their address previously collected.</li>
<li>Instruct participants that they must announce to the study staff if they are going to leave the screen (to get water, to sit down or to take a bathroom break).</li>
<li>Check for room safety</li>
<li>Chair must not have wheels</li>
<li>Either fully ON or fully off a rug</li>

<ul>
<li>Observe for flushed face, increased perfusion, pale features</li>
<li>Monitor HR and record on redcap</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="after-the-session">After the session:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Record information on scheduling &amp; info document </li>
<li>Date of intervention</li>
<li>Intervention version</li>
<li>Write post intervention report on teams </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="post-intervention-report">Post intervention report</h2>
<ul>
<li>Reporting will be done by replying on the participant specific teams channel under "general/posts". </li>
<li>Examples of things to report: </li>
<li>No issues, session went well. </li>
<li>Session started X mintues late because of X. </li>
<li>Session ended X minutes early because of X. </li>
<li>Hyperate4health was not recorded because of X. </li>
<li>Reached symptom threshold at minute X. </li>
<li>Participant had a complaint about X. </li>
<li>Participant mentioned something important (upcoming travels, change in job, moving, sickness, injury, allergies, change in medication, etc) </li>
<li>Heartrate monitor was acting weird. <em>insert debugging done to fix it</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="possible-events-and-action-plans">Possible Events and Action Plans</h2>
<h3 id="a-the-participant-is-off-screen-for-more-than-1-minute">A. The participant is off screen for more than 1 minute</h3>

<h3 id="b-the-participant-appears-to-be-struggling-with-exercise">B. The participant appears to be struggling with exercise</h3>
<p><em>(e.g., taking more breaks than normal, visibly in pain)</em>
- Stop the session to check in and make sure they are okay.
- If the participant would like to continue exercising, advise them to modify (e.g., reduce intensity or do exercises seated).

- If concerned about their safety, call again.
- If the participant completes the class but you remain concerned, call them after class to check in and notify Dr. Morris of the situation.</p>
<h3 id="c-the-participant-falls-or-is-in-respiratory-distress">C. The participant falls or is in respiratory distress</h3>
<ul>
<li>If the participant has clearly fallen and is not getting up, immediately stop the class via Zoom and call out to check responsiveness.</li>
<li>If unresponsive, call emergency services and provide the participant’s address.</li>
<li>If the situation is non-emergent, call the participant immediately to check in.</li>
<li>If the participant is unsure whether they need help and is experiencing difficulty breathing, chest pain, irregular heart rate, or other cardiac symptoms:</li>

- Disconnect and reconnect HR monitor from hyperate app
- Disconnect and reconnect HR monitor from bluetooth settings in phone
- Put water on the strap (not the actual monitor)
- Unclip and reclip the monitor from the strap</p></div>
