<h2 id="prior-to-baseline-inquiryinterest-etc">Prior to Baseline- Inquiry/Interest etc.</h2>
<p>•   Sources
  o RedCap form for interest
       Links to it from the QR code on flyer or Facebook/Instagram ads
       After reaching out via email to schedule call, label email under TECHS to notate it is        present in RedCap
  o Calls/Emails
       Directed to either google voice number or lab email
       Add to RedCap regardless of eligibility
       Email is labeled under TECHS once it is added to RedCap and PSL
•   The RedCap form should eliminate inclusion/exclusion on age and length of time since brain injury
  o If ineligible, send an email using template to tell them we appreciate their inquiry, but   they are not eligible at this time. </p>
<h2 id="redcap">Redcap:</h2>
<h3 id="entering-new-participant">Entering New Participant</h3>
<p>•   Participant should begin with inquiry (whether on the phone, email, or online survey (where it’s completed automatically)) 
•   Change to techsID after prescreening is complete and participant is scheduled 
Pre-Screening Call- can be completed by trained uga
•   Attempt to confirm a scheduled call over email prior to calling, if possible, if not simply call during appropriate business hours
•   Use RedCap form for Prescreening and go through the criteria as questions
  o If unsure, leave a comment or note on the redcap form
  o If they flag one of the immediate inclusion/exclusion factors you do not have to continue     the call (not cleared for exercise, age, time since injury or location (if they can travel     to Boston for the baseline without any financial help from us but live elsewhere, that can     work))
       If you’re unsure, finish the call and consult Emma afterwards.
  o If they don't have a diagnosis, you can continue the call and ask if they are willing to speak with a clinician to confirm diagnosis. If there is any uncertainty on diagnosis, wait to schedule until Lexie MD verified.
•   Complete the MRI Subject Screening Form to ensure they can safely have an MRI (Either done on the computer or a hard copy can be printed and scanned in)
  o This needs to be de-identified and sent to Fred with scheduled MRI appointment. 
•   Once scheduled, add to basecamp, scheduling and info sheet, and techs master doc
•   Once scheduled, send confirmation email attached with briefing form, parking information, and consent form.  Ask them to send confirmation of concussion diagnosis as well (unless we are waiting for lexie MD)</p>
<h3 id="potential-holding-patterns-that-can-occur-in-between-the-ps-call-scheduling-baseline">Potential “Holding Patterns” That Can Occur In Between The PS Call &amp; Scheduling Baseline</h3>
<p>•   Awaiting Lexie MD confirmation on diagnosis
•   Confirm MRI safety with Fred/Valur or participant
•   Participant needs to confirm exercise safety with PCP or cardiologist
•   Participant needs to arrange travel (emphasizing we do not cover this, but they do voluntarily)</p>
<h3 id="scheduling-baseline-session">Scheduling Baseline Session</h3>
<p>•   Should be done with or by Emma
  o Scheduled primarily due to MRI availability (accessed through Emma/Lexie outlook calendar) as that’s the most restrictive
  o Secondly confirm Emma, Mark, and one of the undergrads availabilities
•   If necessary to be in 2 sessions, try to have as close together as possible
•   Remind of session 24-48 hours prior via text message</p>
<h3 id="preparing-for-baseline">Preparing for Baseline</h3>
<p>•   Ensure proper rooms are scheduled for Baseline
  o Neuropysch Room for cognitive/questionnaires
       Have this reserved for after EEG as well for the tech set-up
  o EEG in EEG Room
  o VO2 room for fitness and balance test
•   Print documents in Print for Baseline
  o Informed Consent (Print 2)
  o W9
  o TMT A/B paper copy
  o Letter/Cat Handout
•   Charge Surface Tablet
•   Initialize actigraph
  o Prepare sleep log and mailing envelop </p>
<h2 id="2-baseline-session">2-Baseline-Session</h2>
<p>•   Consent &amp; W9
  o Go through consent form and provide them a copy with the person administering the consent   signing (the important thing is to have the copy we keep having both signatures and they one   they take home having our signature)
  o Have them complete the W9 at this time as well
•   Make sure we have their emergency contact. It should be in prescreening and on techs master doc</p>
